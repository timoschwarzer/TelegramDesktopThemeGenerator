# Telegram Desktop Theme Generator
This is a simple Theme Generator script currently avaliable for:
 * [Windows PowerShell](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timoschwarzer/TelegramDesktopThemeGenerator/master/GenerateThemes.ps1)

Usage:
 * Create your base theme and name it `base.tdesktop-theme`
 * Copy your background image `tiled.png` into your directory
 * Edit your variables in the script file
 * Run the script and it will create all the `.tdesktop-theme` files for you
 * (Optional) Leave a link to this repo when publishing your themes. It doesn't hurt. ;-)
